1. Key Technical Factors

1.1 Scalability & Infrastructure
Platform A
Pros: Already has built-in governance for separate deployments, specialized analytics/observability.
Cons: Smaller AKS cluster, limited namespace separation, potential scaling issues if usage grows rapidly or unpredictably.
Platform B
Pros: Larger AKS cluster, strong ability to scale horizontally/vertically.
Cons: Could require new integration for the analytics/experimentation that resides on Platform A.
Impact of Team Familiarity:

Because the team is comfortable with Platform A’s environment and tools, they may handle infrastructure constraints more efficiently (e.g., quickly adding new cluster resources, if that’s allowed).
On Platform B, the team would have a learning curve for DevOps or deployment processes, potentially causing delays.
1.2 Required Services (OCR, Data Fetch, LLM)
Data Fetch:
Likely can be done on either platform, depending on where your data sources are hosted.
OCR:
Only available on Platform B.
If you deploy your main application on Platform A, you’ll need to integrate with OCR running on Platform B (cross-cluster communication, authentication, and networking required).
LLM / Annotation:
If the LLM is available on Platform A or can be integrated there, the team’s familiarity might streamline development.
However, if the LLM is not native to either platform, you’ll still need external integration, which might not strongly favor A or B.
Trade-Off:

Hosting on Platform A means bridging to Platform B for OCR.
Hosting on Platform B means bridging back to Platform A for analytics/experimentation.
1.3 Observability & Experimentation
Platform A:
Core analytics, performance observability, and experiment service built in (a strong advantage).
If A is the primary hosting environment, you immediately leverage these capabilities without extra development overhead.
Platform B:
Would need to develop or configure a new pathway to push metrics and data to Platform A if you want to use those experiment services.
Alternatively, you’d have to replicate or implement your own observability and A/B testing frameworks on Platform B.
Impact:

If experimentation and observability are critical to your success (e.g., rapidly iterating, comparing model versions, measuring user or model performance), having these capabilities built in can be a decisive factor.
Team familiarity with these analytics workflows will reduce friction and speed up iteration if you run the app on Platform A.
2. Governance and Deployment Pipelines

Platform A:
Allows separate deployments per governance constraints, providing more granular control for each microservice (or each environment).
However, the cluster itself is smaller and does not have clear namespace separation for multi-tenant or multi-app scenarios, which can complicate advanced isolation needs.
Platform B:
Monorepo structure with a single deployment pipeline can be simpler for integrated, cross-service deployments.
But less flexible governance—teams might have to align on the same pipeline release cadence.
Integrating with the advanced analytics pipeline (on Platform A) would require additional orchestrations or triggers in that monorepo pipeline.
Impact:

Since the team is already well-versed in Platform A’s governance and pipeline, the overhead of customizing or setting up new releases on Platform B might be significant.
If separate microservices need frequent or independent deployment cycles, the monorepo approach on Platform B might feel restrictive to a team used to more autonomy.
3. Human Factors (Now Favoring Platform A)

Team Skills & Familiarity:
The engineering team and solution architect have deeper expertise in Platform A.
Using Platform B would require them to learn new deployment patterns, tooling, and processes, which may delay progress.
Ownership & Momentum:
The team feels a sense of ownership over the analytics and experiment framework in Platform A.
They might be more motivated and faster to iterate on Platform A.
Risk & Confidence:
A comfortable team is less prone to mistakes and can troubleshoot issues more quickly.
Shifting to Platform B might introduce more risk and uncertainty, especially with tight deadlines.
4. Potential Hybrid or Split Approach

Deploy the Core App on Platform A, Integrate OCR from Platform B
Pros:
You keep your main application code, LLM, analytics, and experimentation in the platform where the team has expertise.
Observability and A/B testing are immediately available without building new connections.
Cons:
OCR calls must cross from Platform A to Platform B.
Potential latency, networking, and security overhead for that cross-platform call.
You still face the risk of scaling limits on Platform A if usage spikes.
Deploy the Core App on Platform B, Integrate Analytics from Platform A
Pros:
Native OCR is local, no cross-platform calls for a key functionality.
Larger AKS cluster for better scaling, might handle high loads more comfortably.
Cons:
The team is less familiar with Platform B, adding training/transition overhead.
Integrating with Platform A’s analytics/experiment service would require new pipelines or data flows.
You lose the easy synergy of having experiment-driven development in the same environment.
5. Weighing the Pros & Cons with the New Assumptions

Platform A
Pros:
Team Familiarity: Minimizes learning curve, fosters ownership.
Analytics & Experimentation: Built-in and robust, easy to use from day one.
Governance & Separate Deployments: Fine-grained control for microservices or different governance policies.
Cons:
Scalability: Smaller AKS cluster, limited namespace isolation—could be a bottleneck if usage grows rapidly or if the LLM component requires substantial compute.
OCR Integration: Must call out to Platform B for a critical step.
Platform B
Pros:
Scalability: Larger cluster, better capacity for compute-intensive tasks (e.g., LLM).
Native OCR: No cross-platform calls for the OCR step.
UI Connectivity: Well-established integration for front-end workflows.
Cons:
Team Inexperience: Potentially a big overhead in knowledge transfer and environment ramp-up.
Analytics & Experimentation: Would require building or configuring new connectors to Platform A or replicating A’s capabilities.
Monorepo: Less flexible for separate microservice deployment and governance.
6. High-Level Recommendation

Given that:

The Team is most comfortable with Platform A.
Analytics and experiment capabilities are core to the project and are natively offered by Platform A.
OCR is a critical but singular function (rather than the entire pipeline) and can be called via an API from Platform B.
It’s generally more advantageous to deploy the application primarily on Platform A and integrate with Platform B only for OCR. Here’s why:

Seamless Experimentation & Observability: If analytics and A/B testing are integral to how you develop, test, and refine your model, you’ll benefit from having these capabilities in the same environment with minimal setup.
Team Productivity: The immediate familiarity and ownership will reduce mistakes, accelerate development, and foster enthusiasm.
OCR as an External Service: While cross-platform calls add some overhead, OCR can typically be exposed as an API. Given that it’s a discrete step, it may be easier to manage as a service integration than replicating (or hooking into) an entire analytics platform.
However, there are two caveats:

Scaling Concerns: If your application (especially the LLM-based annotation) is expected to grow significantly in usage, you’ll need to plan for expanding Platform A’s cluster resources—or at least be prepared to do so quickly. Work with your DevOps or infrastructure teams to ensure capacity can scale to meet future demand.
Latency and Reliability: Calling OCR remotely on Platform B means you must establish stable, low-latency, and secure connectivity. Plan the network routing, authentication, and potential fallback strategies (e.g., if the OCR service is briefly unavailable).
7. Final Thoughts & Next Steps

Proof of Concept: Start by implementing a small-scale version of the pipeline on Platform A, calling out to Platform B for OCR. Validate performance, latency, and potential scale issues.
Capacity Planning: Work with your platform/infrastructure team to ensure the AKS cluster on Platform A can handle peak loads (especially for LLM tasks).
Monitoring & Governance: Leverage Platform A’s robust observability to watch resource usage. Make sure your governance constraints don’t overly complicate the integration with Platform B.
Plan for Growth: If usage or data volume explodes, reevaluate whether you need a bigger cluster—or if a partial or eventual migration to Platform B for heavy compute might become necessary.
By following this approach, you align with the team’s strengths, make full use of Platform A’s analytics and experimentation features, and minimize the friction required to incorporate OCR from Platform B.
