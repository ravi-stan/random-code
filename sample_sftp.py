I step into the office, coffee steaming in my hand,
Prepared to build the next big thing—at least, that was the plan.
But first comes Policy Portal, where the tickets chatter loud:
“Submit your form in triplicate, and CC half the crowd.”

A left turn to Compliance Gate—please swipe your badge again.
Reviewers wield their rubber stamps like twirling fountain pens.
Security performs a dance, encryption takes a bow;
They’re guarding every semicolon in the code I haven’t written … wow.

Then Audit rides a unicycle, juggling SLA’s;
Procurement sells popcorn, shouting, “Scope change? Add delays!”
Legal cues the tigers, roaring “Reg-u-la-tion 78!”
(If you’ve never heard that statute, don’t worry—it’s first-rate.)

At last, the Ringmaster—Governance—cracks a velvet whip,
Announcing more “required docs” before the project ship.
We leap through flaming hoops of risk, spin cartwheels on red tape,
Yet somehow stick the landing with a smile upon our face.

So here’s a toast to every clown and acrobat we know:
You keep the tent from falling, even if the pacing’s slow.
Though hoops are high and rings are tight, one truth still rings out clear:
This circus only dazzles ’cause the whole troupe’s here—cheer!
